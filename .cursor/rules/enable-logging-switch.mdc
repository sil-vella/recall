# Enable Logging Switch for Testing

## Overview

Enable `LOGGING_SWITCH` constants in related files to test latest changes by reading logs in the `server.log` file.

## Usage

When working with files that contain `LOGGING_SWITCH`:
1. Set `LOGGING_SWITCH = false` in the file you're debugging
2. Run the application to generate logs
3. Check `python_base_04/tools/logger/server.log` for debug output
4. Remember to set `LOGGING_SWITCH = false` when done testing

## Files Using LOGGING_SWITCH

This pattern is commonly found in:
- Flutter/Dart game files (`flutter_base_05/lib/modules/dutch_game/**/*.dart`)
- Python backend files (`python_base_04/**/*.py`)
- State management and validation utilities
- Game logic and round management files
