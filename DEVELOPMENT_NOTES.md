# Development Notes

## Next Steps

### Frontend Card Display Enhancement
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Pending

**Task**: Modify the frontend to show collection rank cards stacked on top of each other with the rank visible at the bottom.

**Requirements**:
- Stack cards vertically with slight offset to show multiple cards
- Position cards so the rank (number/value) is visible at the bottom
- Maintain visual hierarchy and readability
- Ensure cards don't completely obscure each other
- Consider responsive design for different screen sizes

**Technical Considerations**:
- Flutter widget positioning (Stack, Positioned, Transform)
- Card layering and z-index management
- Touch/click interaction with stacked cards
- Animation for card stacking/unstacking
- Performance optimization for multiple card renders

**Files to Modify**:
- Card display widgets in Flutter app
- Potentially game state management for card positioning
- UI components for collection view

**Notes**:
- Current file being worked on: `flutter_base_05/assets/predefined_hands.yaml`
- This enhancement will improve the visual representation of card collections
- Consider accessibility for screen readers when implementing
