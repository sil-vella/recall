During Play:

For each queen played, the player can look at any one of his or other player’s playing cards.
For each jack played, the player can switch any two playing cards of any player.

Game Play:

The aim of the game is to finish with no cards, or with as few points as possible with the least amount of cards. The game finishes either when a player has no more cards left, or when a player calls ‘Recall’, starting the final round.

A full deck of cards is shuffled and each player is dealt 4 cards face down. The player can look at any 2 of his 4 cards and place them back face down, one next to the other. The rest of the deck is placed face down in the middle as the draw deck.

Player one picks and looks at the top card from the draw deck. The player must decide whether to play that card or any of their other 4 cards. If one of the other cards is played, the newly drawn card will replace the played card and placed face down. The played card goes next to the draw deck and is placed face up. This is the discarded deck.

Player two does the same however now they have the option of taking the top card from the discarded cards deck. Doing so, may let the other players know at least one of your cards.

Whenever a card is played, if any of the other players have a same rank card, regardless of the colour, that player can play that card out of turn. They have time to do so until the next player plays. 

After a player has played their card, they have the option to call ‘Recall’, signaling this was their last play and the final round has started. At the end all players reveal their cards, and the player with the least points is the winner. If two people have the same amount of points, the player with the least cards wins. In the case where players have the same amount of points and cards, it’s a draw, unless one of the players is the one who called ‘Recall’, in that case that player is the winner.
