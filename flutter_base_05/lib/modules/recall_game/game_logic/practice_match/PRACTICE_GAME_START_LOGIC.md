# Practice Game Start Match Logic

This document outlines the backend start match logic adapted for practice games, excluding validation & setup steps that are not needed in practice mode.

## üéÆ Overview

The practice game start match process replicates the backend `on_start_match` logic but without WebSocket validation and session management.

## üîÑ Step-by-Step Process

### ~~1. Validation & Setup~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
~~- Validates: Game ID exists and game is found~~
~~- Extracts: User ID from session data~~
~~- Error Handling: Sends error messages if validation fails~~

### ~~2. Player Management~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
~~```dart~~
~~// Check if minimum players requirement is met~~
~~current_players = game.players.length~~
~~min_players = game.min_players~~

~~if (current_players < min_players) {~~
~~  // Add computer players to reach minimum~~
~~  players_needed = min_players - current_players~~
~~  for (i in range(players_needed)) {~~
~~    computer_id = "computer_${game.game_id}_${i}"~~
~~    computer_name = "Computer_${i+1}"~~
~~    computer_player = ComputerPlayer(computer_id, computer_name, difficulty: "medium")~~
~~    game.add_player(computer_player)~~
~~  }~~
~~}~~
~~```~~
~~- **Checks**: If minimum players requirement is met~~
~~- **Auto-fills**: Adds computer players if needed (medium difficulty)~~
~~- **Creates**: Unique computer player IDs and names~~

### ~~3. Game State Initialization~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
~~```dart~~
~~game.phase = GamePhase.DEALING_CARDS~~
~~game.game_start_time = DateTime.now()~~
~~```~~
~~- **Phase Change**: `WAITING_FOR_PLAYERS` ‚Üí `DEALING_CARDS`~~
~~- **Timing**: Records game start timestamp~~

### ~~4. Deck Creation & Card Dealing~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
~~```dart~~
~~// Create deck with all card types~~
~~deck = DeckFactory.buildDeck(includeJokers: true)~~
~~game.deck.cards = deck~~

~~// Deal 4 cards to each player~~
~~for (player in game.players.values) {~~
~~  for (i in 0..3) {~~
~~    card = game.deck.drawCard()~~
~~    if (card != null) {~~
~~      player.addCardToHand(card)~~
~~    }~~
~~  }~~
~~}~~
~~```~~
~~- **Deck Factory**: Creates standard deck with jokers, queens, jacks, kings~~
~~- **Card Dealing**: Each player gets 4 cards~~
~~- **Deck State**: Remaining cards become draw pile~~

### ~~5. Pile Setup~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
~~```dart~~
~~// Move remaining cards to draw pile~~
~~drawPile = List<Map<String, dynamic>>.from(remainingDeck)~~
~~discardPile = <Map<String, dynamic>>[]~~
~~
~~// Start discard pile with first card from draw pile~~
~~if (drawPile.isNotEmpty) {~~
~~  firstCard = drawPile.removeAt(0)~~
~~  discardPile.add(firstCard)~~
~~}~~
~~```~~
~~- **Draw Pile**: All remaining cards from deck~~
~~- **Discard Pile**: First card from draw pile (face up)~~
~~- **Deck**: Emptied after dealing~~

### ~~6. Game Flow Initialization~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
~~```dart~~
~~currentPlayer = dealtPlayers.isNotEmpty ? dealtPlayers.first : null~~
~~gameState['currentPlayer'] = currentPlayer~~
~~gameState['phase'] = 'dealing_cards'~~
~~gameState['gameStartTime'] = DateTime.now().toIso8601String()~~
~~```~~
~~- **First Player**: Sets first player (human) as current player~~
~~- **Phase**: Cards have been dealt, ready for initial peek~~
~~- **Timing**: Records game start timestamp~~

### ~~7. Player Status Updates~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
~~```dart~~
~~// Update all players to INITIAL_PEEK status~~
~~for (final player in dealtPlayers) {~~
~~  player['status'] = 'initial_peek'~~
~~}~~
~~```~~
~~- **Status Change**: All players set to `initial_peek`~~
~~- **Ready for**: Initial peek phase (10-second timer)~~
- **Efficiency**: Single batch update

### 8. Initial Peek Phase
```dart
// Set all players to INITIAL_PEEK status
for (player in game.players.values) {
  if (player.is_active) {
    player.set_status(PlayerStatus.INITIAL_PEEK)
  }
}

// Start 10-second timer for initial peek
startInitialPeekTimer(duration: 10)
```
- **Player Status**: All players ‚Üí `INITIAL_PEEK`
- **Timer**: 10-second countdown for players to peek at cards
- **Purpose**: Players can look at 2 of their 4 cards

## üéØ Key State Changes

### Game State Properties Updated:
- `phase`: `WAITING_FOR_PLAYERS` ‚Üí `DEALING_CARDS` ‚Üí `PLAYER_TURN`
- `game_start_time`: Current timestamp
- `last_action_time`: Current timestamp
- `current_player_id`: First player in list
- `deck.cards`: Full deck ‚Üí Empty (after dealing)
- `draw_pile`: Empty ‚Üí Remaining cards after dealing
- `discard_pile`: Empty ‚Üí First card from draw pile

### Player State Properties Updated:
- `status`: `WAITING` ‚Üí `READY` ‚Üí `INITIAL_PEEK`
- `hand`: Empty ‚Üí 4 cards dealt
- `cards_to_peek`: Empty ‚Üí 2 cards (during peek phase)

### New Objects Created:
- **Computer Players**: If needed to meet minimum player count
- **Deck**: Full standard deck with all card types
- **Timer**: 10-second initial peek timer

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timeline Flow
1. **T+0s**: Game start initiated
2. **T+0s**: Players added if needed, deck created
3. **T+0s**: Cards dealt (4 per player)
4. **T+0s**: Piles setup, first player set
5. **T+0s**: All players status ‚Üí `READY`
6. **T+0s**: Initial peek phase starts (10s timer)
7. **T+10s**: Timer expires, players ‚Üí `WAITING`, game begins

## üîÑ State Updates Triggered
- **Game State Update**: Multiple times during initialization
- **Player Updates**: Individual player status changes
- **UI Updates**: Game phase changes and player additions

## üìù Implementation Notes

### Practice Game Specific Adaptations:
- **No WebSocket Validation**: Skip session validation and error handling
- **Direct State Updates**: Use `updatePracticeGameState()` instead of WebSocket events
- **Local Timer Management**: Handle initial peek timer locally
- **Simplified Error Handling**: Basic error handling without coordinator integration

### Key Differences from Backend:
- **No Session Management**: Direct state updates instead of WebSocket events
- **No Coordinator Integration**: Simplified error handling
- **Local Timer Handling**: Practice game manages its own timers
- **Direct Player Creation**: No need for session-based player creation

This comprehensive initialization ensures the practice game is properly set up with all necessary components before actual gameplay begins!
