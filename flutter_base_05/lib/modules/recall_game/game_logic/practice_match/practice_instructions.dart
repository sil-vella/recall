Game Rules

🎯 WHAT TO DO:
• Tap any 2 cards to peek at them

You have 10 seconds to look at 2 of your 4 cards!

🎯 HOW TO PEEK:
• Tap any 2 cards in your hand
• The cards will flip to show their values
• Choose wisely - you can't change your selection

💡 WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
• High-value cards (10+ points) to avoid
• Special cards (Queens, Jacks, Kings) for powers
• Low-value cards (Aces, 2s, 3s) to keep

⏰ HURRY! Timer is running...''',

Choose where to draw from:

📦 DRAW PILE (Face Down):
• Draw a random card from the deck
• No one knows what you got
• Safe but unpredictable

🗑️ DISCARD PILE (Face Up):
• Take the top card everyone can see
• You know exactly what you're getting
• Others can see what you took

💡 STRATEGY:
• Draw pile: When you want surprise cards
• Discard pile: When you see a good card you want

⏰ Choose quickly!''',

Choose a card to play to the discard pile:

🃏 CARD SELECTION:
• Tap any card in your hand to play it
• The card will go to the discard pile
• Other players can see what you played

💡 STRATEGY:
• Get rid of high-value cards first
• Keep low-value cards for later
• Watch what others are discarding

🎮 SPECIAL CARDS:
• Queens: Let you peek at opponent's cards
• Jacks: Let you swap cards with opponents
• Use them strategically!
