/// # Recall Module Manager
/// 
/// The central orchestrator for all Recall card game functionality. This manager serves as the
/// primary interface between the game logic, WebSocket communication, and state management.
/// 
/// ## Core Responsibilities:
/// 
/// ### Game State Management
/// - Tracks current game state, game ID, and player ID
/// - Manages game lifecycle (initialization, active state, cleanup)
/// - Coordinates with StateManager for persistent state storage
/// 
/// ### WebSocket Communication
/// - Establishes and maintains WebSocket connections for real-time gameplay
/// - Handles connection state and automatic reconnection logic
/// - Integrates with WebSocketManager for reliable communication
/// 
/// ### Event Coordination
/// - Provides centralized event streaming for game updates
/// - Manages event subscriptions and cleanup
/// - Coordinates between different game components via event system
/// 
/// ### Integration Points
/// - **StateManager**: Uses existing `recall_game` state registration from main module
/// - **WebSocketManager**: Leverages core WebSocket infrastructure
/// - **Game Models**: Works with GameState, Player, Card, and GameEvent models
/// - **Game Helpers**: Utilizes RecallGameHelpers for game logic operations
/// 
/// ## Architecture Pattern:
/// 
/// This manager follows the singleton pattern to ensure consistent game state across
/// the application. It acts as a facade that coordinates multiple subsystems:
/// 
/// ```
/// RecallModuleManager
/// ├── WebSocket Communication (via WebSocketManager)
/// ├── State Persistence (via StateManager) 
/// ├── Event Broadcasting (via StreamController)
/// └── Game Logic (via RecallGameHelpers)
/// ```
/// 
/// ## Usage:
/// 
/// ```dart
/// final gameManager = RecallModuleManager();
/// 
/// // Initialize the manager
/// await gameManager.initialize();
/// 
/// // Connect WebSocket when authentication is available
/// await gameManager.connectWebSocket();
/// 
/// // Listen to game events
/// gameManager.gameEvents.listen((event) {
///   // Handle game events
/// });
/// 
/// // Check game state
/// if (gameManager.hasActiveGame) {
///   final gameState = gameManager.currentGameState;
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// ## Lifecycle:
/// 
/// 1. **Initialization**: Sets up event streams and validates dependencies
/// 2. **WebSocket Connection**: Establishes real-time communication when auth is ready
/// 3. **Game Operations**: Coordinates gameplay through helper methods
/// 4. **Cleanup**: Properly disposes resources and closes connections
/// 
/// ## Thread Safety:
/// 
/// The manager includes initialization guards to prevent race conditions during
/// concurrent initialization attempts, ensuring safe usage in multi-threaded contexts.
