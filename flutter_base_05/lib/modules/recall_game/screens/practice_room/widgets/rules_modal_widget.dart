Finish with no cards OR have the fewest points when someone calls "Recall".

üÉè CARD VALUES
‚Ä¢ Numbered cards (2-10): Points equal to card number
‚Ä¢ Ace: 1 point
‚Ä¢ Queens & Jacks: 10 points
‚Ä¢ Kings (Black): 10 points
‚Ä¢ Joker & Red King: 0 points

üéÆ HOW TO PLAY
1. **Initial Peek**: Look at 2 of your 4 cards (10 seconds)
2. **Your Turn**: Draw a card from draw pile or discard pile
3. **Play or Keep**: Play a card to discard pile or keep it in hand
4. **Next Player**: Turn passes to the next player
5. **Call Recall**: When you think you can win, call "Recall"

üÉè SPECIAL CARDS
‚Ä¢ **Queens**: Let you peek at any opponent's card
‚Ä¢ **Jacks**: Let you swap any two cards between players
‚Ä¢ **Jokers**: 0 points - very valuable!
‚Ä¢ **Red King**: 0 points - very valuable!

üèÜ WINNING
‚Ä¢ **Immediate Win**: First player to have no cards
‚Ä¢ **After Recall**: Lowest points wins
‚Ä¢ **Tie Breaker**: Fewer cards wins
‚Ä¢ **Recall Caller**: Wins ties if involved

üí° STRATEGY TIPS
‚Ä¢ Get rid of high-value cards first
‚Ä¢ Remember cards you've seen
‚Ä¢ Watch what others discard
‚Ä¢ Use special cards strategically
‚Ä¢ Call "Recall" when you're confident

üéØ PRACTICE MODE
‚Ä¢ Play against AI opponents
‚Ä¢ Learn the game at your own pace
‚Ä¢ No time pressure (if timer is off)
‚Ä¢ Get helpful instructions during play
‚Ä¢ Perfect for learning the game!''';
