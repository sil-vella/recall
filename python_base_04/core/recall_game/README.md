# Recall Game System

A comprehensive implementation of the Recall card game with declarative rule processing, AI players, and real-time WebSocket communication.

## Overview

The Recall game system is built on the Python Base 04 architecture and provides:

- **Declarative Game Logic**: Game rules are defined in YAML files for easy modification
- **AI Players**: Computer players with configurable difficulty levels
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket-based multiplayer support using existing architecture
- **Special Power Cards**: Extended game mechanics with special abilities
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Live Reference System**: Auto-generated HTML reference for all declarations

## Integration with Python Base 04

### WebSocket Integration

The Recall game system integrates with the existing WebSocket architecture:

```python
# Initialize with app_manager
websocket_manager = RecallGameWebSocketManager(app_manager)
websocket_manager.initialize(app_manager)

# Register game-specific handlers
websocket_manager.register_handler('recall_join_game', handler_function)
websocket_manager.register_handler('recall_player_action', handler_function)
```

### Event Flow

1. **Client Connection**: Uses existing WebSocket manager
2. **Game Events**: Registered with `recall_` prefix
3. **Session Management**: Leverages existing session tracking
4. **Room Management**: Uses existing room system
5. **Broadcasting**: Uses existing broadcast methods

### WebSocket Events

| Event | Description | Data |
|-------|-------------|------|
| `recall_join_game` | Join a game | `session_id`, `game_id`, `player_name`, `player_type` |
| `recall_leave_game` | Leave a game | `session_id`, `game_id` |
| `recall_player_action` | Play a card | `session_id`, `game_id`, `action_type`, `card_id` |
| `recall_call_recall` | Call Recall | `session_id`, `game_id` |
| `recall_play_out_of_turn` | Play out of turn | `session_id`, `game_id`, `card_id` |
| `recall_use_special_power` | Use special power | `session_id`, `game_id`, `power_type`, `target_data` |

## Game Rules

### Card Point System
- **Joker Cards**: 0 points
- **Red King**: 0 points
- **Ace cards**: 1 point
- **Numbered cards**: Points equal to their number (2-10)
- **All Kings (except red)**: 10 points
- **All Queens and Jacks**: 10 points
- **Added Power cards**: Special added powers (subject to conditions)

### Special Card Abilities
- **Queens**: When played, look at any one card (own or other player's)
- **Jacks**: When played, switch any two playing cards between any players
- **Added Power cards**: Additional special abilities beyond standard queen/jack powers

### Game Flow
1. **Setup**: Each player is dealt 4 cards face down
2. **Initial Look**: Players can look at any 2 of their 4 cards
3. **Turns**: Players draw and play cards, replacing played cards
4. **Out-of-turn Play**: Players can play cards of the same rank when others play
5. **Recall**: Any player can call "Recall" to start the final round
6. **End Game**: Player with least points wins (tiebreaker: least cards, then Recall caller)

## Declarative Rules System

### Action Rules (`game_rules/actions/`)

Action rules define how player actions are processed:

```yaml
action_type: "play_card"                    # Rule identifier
triggers:                                   # When this rule applies
  - condition: "is_player_turn"            # Condition to check
    game_state: "player_turn"              # Required game state
    out_of_turn: false                     # Additional parameters
  - condition: "same_rank_card"            # Alternative trigger
    game_state: "out_of_turn_play"
    out_of_turn: true

validation:                                 # Validation checks
  - check: "player_has_card"               # Check type
    card_id: "{card_id}"                   # Parameter with placeholder
  - check: "card_is_playable"
    card_rank: "{card_rank}"

effects:                                   # State changes to apply
  - type: "move_card_to_discard"          # Effect type
    from: "player_hand"
    to: "discard_pile"
    card_id: "{card_id}"
  
  - type: "replace_card_in_hand"          # Another effect
    player_id: "{player_id}"
    new_card: "drawn_card"
  
  - type: "check_special_power"           # Special power check
    card_rank: "{card_rank}"
    if_power: "trigger_special_ability"
  
  - type: "check_recall_opportunity"      # Recall opportunity
    if_called: "start_final_round"

notifications:                             # Events to broadcast
  - type: "broadcast"                      # Notification type
    event: "card_played"                   # Event name
    data:                                 # Event data with placeholders
      player_id: "{player_id}"
      card: "{card_data}"
      is_out_of_turn: "{out_of_turn}"

  - type: "broadcast"
    event: "check_out_of_turn_play"
    data:
      played_card_rank: "{card_rank}"
      timeout: 5000
```

### Card Rules (`game_rules/cards/`)

Card-specific rules define special abilities:

```yaml
card_type: "queen"                         # Card type
points: 10                                 # Point value
special_power: "peek_at_card"             # Special power type

power_effect:                              # Power effect definition
  type: "peek_at_card"                    # Effect type
  description: "Look at any one card (own or other player's)"
  validation:                              # Power validation
    - check: "card_in_hand"
      card_rank: "queen"
  execution:                               # Power execution
    - type: "show_card_to_player"
      target_player: "{player_id}"
      card_owner: "{target_player_id}"
      card_position: "{card_position}"
  notifications:                           # Power notifications
    - type: "private"
      event: "card_revealed"
      target: "{player_id}"
      data:
        card: "{card_data}"
        owner: "{card_owner}"

play_conditions:                           # When card can be played
  - condition: "is_player_turn"
  - condition: "card_in_hand"
    card_rank: "queen"

out_of_turn_play:                         # Out-of-turn play rules
  allowed: true
  condition: "same_rank_card"
```

### Special Power Rules (`game_rules/special_powers/`)

Additional power card rules:

```yaml
power_id: "steal_card"                    # Power identifier
card_type: "added_power"                  # Card type
points: 5                                 # Point value
special_power: "steal_card"               # Power type

power_effect:                              # Power effect
  type: "steal_card"
  description: "Steal a card from another player's hand"
  validation:                              # Validation
    - check: "target_player_has_cards"
      target_player: "{target_player_id}"
  execution:                               # Execution
    - type: "move_card"
      from_player: "{target_player_id}"
      to_player: "{player_id}"
      card_position: "{card_position}"
  notifications:                           # Notifications
    - type: "private"
      event: "card_stolen"
      target: "{target_player_id}"
    - type: "broadcast"
      event: "power_card_used"
      data:
        player_id: "{player_id}"
        power_type: "steal_card"

play_conditions:                           # Play conditions
  - condition: "is_player_turn"
  - condition: "card_in_hand"
    card_rank: "power_steal_card"

out_of_turn_play:                         # Out-of-turn rules
  allowed: false
```

### AI Decision Rules (`game_rules/ai_logic/`)

AI behavior is defined declaratively:

```yaml
decision_type: "play_card"                 # Decision type
triggers:                                  # When to make this decision
  - condition: "is_my_turn"
    priority: 1

evaluation:                                # Evaluation factors
  - factor: "card_points"                  # Factor name
    weight: 0.4                           # Weight in decision
    strategy: "minimize_points"            # Strategy to apply
  
  - factor: "special_power_utility"
    weight: 0.3
    strategy: "maximize_utility"
  
  - factor: "game_progression"
    weight: 0.2
    strategy: "advance_position"
  
  - factor: "risk_assessment"
    weight: 0.1
    strategy: "minimize_risk"

decision_logic:                            # Decision logic
  - if: "has_low_point_card"              # Condition
    then: "play_lowest_point_card"        # Action
  
  - if: "has_special_power_card"
    and: "power_is_useful"                # Multiple conditions
    then: "play_special_power_card"
  
  - if: "can_call_recall"
    and: "advantageous_position"
    then: "call_recall"
  
  - else: "play_safest_card"              # Default action

default_action: "play_safest_card"         # Fallback action
```

## Usage Examples

### Module Integration

```python
from core.recall_game.websocket_handlers.game_websocket_manager import RecallGameWebSocketManager

class RecallGameModule:
    def __init__(self, app_manager):
        self.app_manager = app_manager
        self.websocket_manager = None
    
    def initialize(self):
        """Initialize the Recall game module"""
        self.websocket_manager = RecallGameWebSocketManager(self.app_manager)
        self.websocket_manager.initialize(self.app_manager)
    
    def create_game(self, max_players=4):
        """Create a new game"""
        return self.websocket_manager.game_state_manager.create_game(max_players)
```

### WebSocket Event Handling

```python
# Client joins game
{
    "event": "recall_join_game",
    "data": {
        "session_id": "session_123",
        "game_id": "game_456",
        "player_name": "Alice",
        "player_type": "human"
    }
}

# Client plays card
{
    "event": "recall_player_action",
    "data": {
        "session_id": "session_123",
        "game_id": "game_456",
        "action_type": "play_card",
        "card_id": "ace_hearts_1234"
    }
}
```

### Processing Player Actions

```python
# Player action
action_data = {
    'action_type': 'play_card',
    'player_id': 'player_1',
    'card_id': 'ace_hearts_1234',
    'game_id': game_id
}

# Process through declarative rules
result = game_logic_engine.process_player_action(game_state, action_data)

if result.get('success'):
    print("Card played successfully")
else:
    print(f"Error: {result.get('error')}")
```

## AI Players

### Difficulty Levels

- **Easy**: Basic card selection, minimal strategy
- **Medium**: Balanced approach, considers special powers
- **Hard**: Advanced strategy, optimal play

### AI Decision Making

AI players use declarative rules to make decisions:

1. **Evaluate Game State**: Assess current position
2. **Calculate Card Values**: Consider points and special powers
3. **Apply Strategy**: Follow difficulty-specific rules
4. **Execute Action**: Play card or call Recall

## Special Power Cards

### Available Powers

- **Steal Card**: Take a card from another player
- **Draw Extra**: Draw additional cards
- **Protect Card**: Prevent card from being stolen
- **Skip Turn**: Skip the next player's turn
- **Double Points**: Double the points of played cards

### Power Usage

Special powers are triggered when their cards are played:

```python
# Use special power
power_data = {
    'session_id': 'session_123',
    'game_id': game_id,
    'power_type': 'steal_card',
    'target_data': {
        'target_player_id': 'player_2',
        'card_position': 0
    }
}

# Send via WebSocket
socket.emit('recall_use_special_power', power_data)
```

## Configuration

### Game Settings

```python
# Game configuration
game_config = {
    'max_players': 4,
    'include_jokers': True,
    'include_special_powers': True,
    'ai_difficulty': 'medium'
}
```

### Rule Customization

Modify YAML files in `game_rules/` to customize:

- Action processing logic
- Card special abilities
- AI decision making
- Game flow rules

## Testing
